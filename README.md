Welcome to my repository, here i have created a small html, css and javascript project that informs users of details about a particular star sign depending on their selection, so as the user clicks on the desired image of sun sign it opens a new tab informing them about what the star sign stored details are also generating some dynamic content randomly.  

Data encapsulation technique has been used over this project and javascript is the main technology used for the operations.
